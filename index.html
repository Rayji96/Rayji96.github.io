      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>Hey! My name is Ray Ji and I'm a first year student in the University of Waterloo. I’m aiming for my bachelor’s in Computing and Financial Management. I have a passion for programming and mathematics and have been programming since my first year of high-school. I’m familiar with Turing, Scheme, HTML, and CSS. I’m currently learning C in my classes and JavaScript on my own. I’ve competed in the CEMC for both the computing and math competitions and was also the vice-president in my high-school computer science and robotics association.
        </p>
        <p>Aside from programming and mathematics I immensely enjoy reading, writing, and running.
